# pygame-raytracer-thingy
A raytracer script made in pygame.  
It's pretty cool.  
The reflections don't work either because I messed them up or because of color being stored as ints in pygame, which is kinda cringe.  
Though, you can kinda see something on the edge of the red sphere, I think that's a reflection. I'm gonna count that as a win.
